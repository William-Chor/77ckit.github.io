    <body>
         Here is my first attempt at making a web page!!
         <br><br>
         This is a link to <a href="http://www.vtc.edu.hk/">VTC</a> home page!
         <br><br>
         <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>

         <a href="mailto:xyz@vtc.edu.hk">VTC Office</a>

         <h1 align="center">Welcome&nbsp;to the World of HTML</h1>
	     <hr>
	     <p>This is some simple text to insert in the document. We
	     could certainly write a great deal of text here.  We
	     could drone on and on and on, but this is enough for
	     now.
	     </p>
         <h1>This is an H1 Element</h1>
         <h2>This is an H2 Element</h2>
         <h3>This is an H3 Element</h3>
         <h4>This is an H4 Element</h4>
         <h5>This is an H5 Element</h5>
         <h6>This is an H6 Element</h6>
         
         <h2 align="center">This is an H2 Element aligned center</h2>
         
         <h3 align="right">This is an H3 Element aligned right</h3>
         
         <h4>This</h4>is an H4 Element but only on the first letter
         <br>
         
         <h7>This is an H7 element? 
         There is no such thing, but type anyway</h7>
